abstract = {Let xi be a random variable over a finite set with an arbitrary probability distribution. Improvements to a fast method of generating sample values for xi in constant time are suggested. The proposed modification reduces the time required for initialization to O(n). For a simple genetic algorithm, this improvement changes an O(g n 1n n) algorithm into an O(g n) algorithm (where g is the number of generations, and n is the population size).},

  abstract={ We describe two methods and provide C programs for generating discrete random variables with functions that are simple and fast, averaging ten times as fast as published methods and more than five times as fast as the fastest of those. We provide general procedures for implementing the two methods, as well as specific procedures for three of the most important discrete distributions: Poisson, binomial and hypergeometric.},
